# AND1-Text-to-Speech-App
🤖This app is created for the Android Developement 1 Course.
The idea is to create an app that will give the user audio based on the inputed text ✍. The audio will be generated by a text-to-speech API 🎙, and it will be available for download 🔽. The app will contain multiple views with smooth navigation. It will be possible to see your previous downloads in form of a list and play them. The data will be stored and handled using Firebase🔥.

[] As a user I want to be able to input text and receive the speech audio.
[] As a user I want to be able to download the output of the inputed text.
[] As a user I want to be able to navigate my previous inputs
[] As a user I want to use the app with an intuitive design
[] As a user I want to be able to choose from multiple voices that will say what I input

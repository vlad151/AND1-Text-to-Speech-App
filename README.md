# AND1-Text-to-Speech-App
🤖This app is created for the Android Developement 1 Course.
The idea is to create an app that will give the user audio based on the inputed text ✍. The audio will be generated by a text-to-speech API 🎙, and it will be available for download 🔽. The app will contain multiple views with smooth navigation. It will be possible to see your previous downloads in form of a list and play them. The data will be stored and handled using Firebase🔥.
